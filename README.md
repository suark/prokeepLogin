## Login Page Project for ProKeep

A sample login page that validates inputs.

- Email must be a valid email address
- Password must be at least 1 character long

The form will be submitted to `https://reqres.in/api/login`.

This project was built using create-react-app, axios, and formik. 

It contains a custom built logo recolor, and favicon.

There is a basic test to make sure the app renders. 

And the main tests:

- A valid login
- And different combinations of invalid logins


Scripts:

- `npm start`: Run the project in dev mode on port 3000
- `npm run test`: Run the jest tests.
